# modbus-master

Android app for controlling any MODBUS device. So far only MODBUS TCP/IP over wifi is implemented, but there is plans to implement MODBUS RTU over bluetooth. Also, only the 10 first addresses of the four types are supported by the UI, but the underlying logic supports all addresses.
